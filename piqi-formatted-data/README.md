# PIQI Formatted Data

The files in this folder have been converted to the PIQI using Clinical Architecture's PIQI Test Client from FHIR data generated by Synthea. 

The original source files for these PIQI messages can be found [elsewhere in this repository](/generated-ehr-data/us-core-compliant/). The filenames of the PIQI data corresponds to the beginning snippet of the CCDA/FHIR filenames.
